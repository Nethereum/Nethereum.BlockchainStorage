# Nethereum.BlockchainStorage

## Summary

This repo is for projects that extend block chain processing.  The core Nethereum libraries (e.g. within Nethereum.Web3) provide crawling, retrieval and filtration mechanisms whilst projects in this repo provide storage for the data.

For examples of block chain processing see:

 * The docs (http://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-log-processing-detail/)
 * Samples on Nethereum Playground (http://playground.nethereum.com/)
